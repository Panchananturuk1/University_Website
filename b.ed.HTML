        <strong>Objectives</strong></p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
&nbsp;Language is the medium for comprehending ideas, for reflection and thinking, as well as for expression and communication. Enhancing one’s facility in the language of instruction is thus a vital need of student teachers, irrespective of the subject areas that they are going to teach. This course is visualized as a range of primarily text-based language activities, which will aid in strengthening the ability to ‘read’, ‘think’, discuss and communicate’ as well as to ‘write’ in the language of instruction. It is likely that student teachers will begin the programme with different levels of language ability; hence group work that supports different levels of learning is envisaged as a central feature of this course. It is also intended that the student teachers will develop a taste for and abilities in reading and making meaning of different kinds of texts. They will also learn to engage with ideas and appreciate that different kinds of writing are used to communicate these ideas in 
        different contexts. Overall, areas of language proficiency which are emphasized are those that will lay a foundation for their becoming self-learners, reflective and expressive teachers, and collaborative professionals.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
        <strong>Unit 1: </strong>Engaging with narrative and descriptive accounts The selected texts could include stories or chapters from fiction, dramatic incidents, vivid descriptive accounts, or even well produced comic strip, stories.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
        <strong>Suggested Activities:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Reading for comprehending and visualizing the account (individual + group reading and discussion/explanation)  Re-telling the account - in one’s own words/from different points of view (taking turns in a smaller group)</p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
&nbsp; Narrating/describing a related account from one’s life experience (in front of a smaller group)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Discussion of characters and situations – sharing interpretations and points of view (in a smaller group)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Writing based on the text – e.g. Summary of a scene, extrapolation of story, converting a situation into a dialogue etc. (individual task)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
        <strong>Unit 2:</strong> Engaging with popular subject-based expository writing The selected texts could include articles, biographical writing, or extracts from popular non-fiction writing, with themes that are drawn from the subject areas of the student teachers (various sciences, mathematics, history, geography, literature/language pieces) For this unit, the student teachers should work in groups divided according to their subjects, within which different texts could be read by different pairs of student teachers.
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style6"><strong>Suggested Activities:</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Reading to extract overall meaning, information, subject knowledge (guided reading in pairs and simple note making)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Identifying major concepts and ideas involved and making notes on these in some schematic form - flow diagram, tree diagram, mind map etc (guided working in pairs)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Explaining the gist of the text/topic to others (in the larger subject group)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Attending to writing style, subject-specific vocabulary and ‘perspective’ or ‘reference frame’ in which different topics are presented – this will vary across subjects and texts, and requires some interpretative skills for ‘placing’ the context of each text (group discussion and sharing)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Writing a review or a summary of the text, with comments and opinions (individual task)</p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
&nbsp;<strong>Unit 3: </strong>Engaging with journalistic writing The selected texts would include newspaper or magazine articles on topics of contemporary interest. Student teachers can be grouped randomly for this unit.</p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
&nbsp;<span class="auto-style6"><strong>Suggested Activities:</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Using reading strategies such as scanning, skimming and reading for extracting information – as appropriate for initial reading of articles (guided individual task)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Analysis of structure of the article, identifying sub-headings, key words, sequencing of ideas, use of concrete details, illustrations and/or statistical representations etc (guided working in pairs)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Critical reading for attending to ‘framing’ of the article, point(s) of view presented, possible biases or slants (small group discussion)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
         Researching and writing articles on topics of local interest (working to produce a local interest magazine)
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">
        &nbsp;Engaging with subject-related reference books: For this unit, the student teachers should work in groups divided according to their subjects. Within these groups, pairs of student teachers would make a choice of a specific topic in their subject area which they could research from a set of available reference books. The focus of this unit is as much the learning of effective processes of reference research and its presentation, as the actual reading of the reference books themselves.

    <p class="auto-style35">
        <strong>Sequence of activities: </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="auto-style35">

    <p class="auto-style35">
        <strong>Unit 5:</strong> Engaging with educational writing Selected texts here could be drawn from the wide range of popular educational writing in the form of well-written essays, extracts or chapters from authors who deal with themes from education, schooling,&nbsp; teaching or learning. The writings selected should present a definite point of view or argument about some aspect of the above themes. Student teachers can be grouped randomly for this unit.
